Canvas Element Overview:
The `<canvas>` element is a part of the HTML5 standard and is used to draw graphics using JavaScript. It is resolution-dependent and works on a bitmap model.

Key Features:
- Drawing shapes such as rectangles, circles, and paths.
- Adding colors, gradients, and patterns.
- Creating animations and dynamic visualizations.
- Rendering text.

Practical Example:
- Drawing a blue rectangle.
- Adding a linear gradient.
- Rendering a filled green circle.

Use Cases:
- Creating games.
- Interactive charts and data visualizations.
- Custom graphics and effects.

Best Practices:
- Always provide fallback content for browsers that do not support `<canvas>`.
- Use JavaScript for all drawing logic to maintain flexibility.
