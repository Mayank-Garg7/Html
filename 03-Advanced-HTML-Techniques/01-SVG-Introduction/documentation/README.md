## Folders & Files Overview

### 1. `assets/`
The `assets/` folder contains all the necessary files that support the visual and interactive elements of the SVG examples.

- **`styles/svg-styles.css`**: This CSS file contains the styles used to enhance the appearance of SVG elements. It includes basic styling, hover effects, and responsive layouts.
  
- **`svg/react-logo.svg`**: This SVG file is an example logo used in one of the demonstrations within the project. You can modify this logo or replace it with any SVG file of your choice for further testing.

### 2. `docs/`
The `docs/` folder contains all the documentation files to guide you through understanding and using the project.

- **`css-style-explanation.md`**: This document explains the CSS code used in the project, including how it styles SVG elements and makes them interactive.

- **`html-svg-explanation.md`**: This file explains how to integrate SVG into HTML, covering both inline SVGs and embedded SVGs.

- **`svg-introduction.md`**: This document introduces you to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), explaining what it is, its advantages, and how it is used in modern web development.

- **`svg-topic-overview.md`**: This file provides an overview of the SVG topic, summarizing the core concepts and key takeaways of the project.

### 3. `example/`
The `example/` folder contains an HTML file that demonstrates how to use SVG in a web page.

- **`svg-example.html`**: This HTML file provides practical examples of SVG elements, such as basic shapes, text, animation, and how to use external SVG files within an HTML document.

### How to Use This Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/01-SVG.git
   ```

2. **Open the Example HTML File**:
   Navigate to the `example/` folder and open the `svg-example.html` file in your browser to see the SVG elements in action.

3. **Explore the Documentation**:
   For a deeper understanding of how SVG works in HTML, check out the documentation files in the `docs/` folder. These files explain key concepts such as styling SVGs, embedding them in HTML, and much more.

4. **Modify the Files**:
   Feel free to experiment with the code and customize the SVG files, styles, and HTML content. You can create your own SVG elements or modify existing ones to better suit your needs.

## Additional Information

- **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)**: SVG is an XML-based vector image format that can be scaled without losing quality. It is widely used in web development for responsive and interactive graphics.
  
- **Responsive Design**: The provided CSS ensures that the SVGs are responsive, meaning they will adjust according to the screen size and provide a seamless experience on mobile devices as well.
