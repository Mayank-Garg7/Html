# SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based format for vector graphics that can scale infinitely without losing quality. It is used to create graphics, icons, and illustrations directly in HTML.

## Key Features
- Resolution-independent and scalable.
- Can be styled with CSS.
- Supports interactivity and animation using JavaScript.
- Lightweight and text-based, making it easy to edit and debug.

## Examples
1. Drawing basic shapes (e.g., rectangles, circles).
2. Using SVG for logos and icons.
3. Animating SVG elements for interactive graphics.

Refer to the `example.html` file for practical demonstrations.
