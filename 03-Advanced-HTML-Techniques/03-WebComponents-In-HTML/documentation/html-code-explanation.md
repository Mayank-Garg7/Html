# Description of the HTML Code

This HTML file demonstrates the use of a custom Web Component and integrates external CSS and JavaScript files for styling and functionality.

## Structure Overview

### 1. **HTML Document Setup**
- The document is defined with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration for HTML5 compatibility.
- The `<html>` element includes the `lang="en"` attribute, indicating the language of the document is English.

### 2. **Head Section**
- The `<head>` section contains metadata and references to external resources:
  - `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding as UTF-8.
  - `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`: Ensures proper scaling and responsiveness on different devices.
  - `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../assets/CSS/style.css">`: Links to an external CSS file located at `../assets/CSS/style.css` for styling the page.
  - `<title>Web Components Example</title>`: Sets the title of the web page displayed in the browser tab.

### 3. **Body Section**
- Contains the main content of the page:
  - `<h1>`: Displays the heading **"Custom Web Component Example"**.
  - `<my-component>`: A placeholder for the custom Web Component, which is defined in the external JavaScript file.

### 4. **External JavaScript**
- `<script src="../assets/JavaScript/script.js"></script>`: Links to an external JavaScript file located at `../assets/JavaScript/script.js`. This script file likely contains the definition and functionality for the custom Web Component.

## Key Features
- **External Styling**: The use of `style.css` allows for a clean separation of concerns, keeping design-related code separate from the HTML.
- **External Functionality**: The custom element logic is encapsulated in `script.js`, promoting modular and reusable code.
- **Responsive Design**: The viewport meta tag ensures the page is mobile-friendly.

## Usage
1. Place the CSS file at the path `../assets/CSS/style.css` to define the appearance of the web page and the custom component.
2. Add the JavaScript file at `../assets/JavaScript/script.js` to implement the behavior of the custom Web Component.
3. When opened in a browser, the page displays the heading and renders the `my-component` element based on its JavaScript definition.
