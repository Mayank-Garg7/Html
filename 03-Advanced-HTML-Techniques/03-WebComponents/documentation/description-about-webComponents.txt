# Topic Description: Web Components

## Overview
Web Components are a set of web platform APIs that allow developers to create custom, reusable, and encapsulated HTML elements. These components work seamlessly with the DOM and other JavaScript frameworks.

## Key Concepts
1. **Custom Elements**:
   - Define your own HTML tags using JavaScript.
   - Example: `<my-component>`.

2. **Shadow DOM**:
   - Provides encapsulation for DOM and CSS, ensuring no conflicts with other parts of the page.

3. **HTML Templates**:
   - Predefined structures used as blueprints for creating DOM elements.

## Use Cases
- Building reusable UI components like buttons, modals, or widgets.
- Encapsulating styles and functionality to prevent conflicts.
- Integrating third-party libraries into applications.

## Example
In `example.html`, a custom component `<my-component>` is defined. It uses Shadow DOM to encapsulate its content, ensuring the style and structure are isolated from the rest of the page.
