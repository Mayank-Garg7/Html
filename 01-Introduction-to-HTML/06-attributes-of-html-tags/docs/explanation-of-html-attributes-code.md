# HTML Tags with Attributes

This document demonstrates various HTML tags with their respective attributes. Below is the explanation for each section of the HTML code.

## Image Tag

The `<img>` tag is used to display an image on a webpage. It has several important attributes:

- `src`: Specifies the path to the image file.
- `alt`: Provides alternative text for the image if it cannot be displayed.
- `width`: Defines the width of the image.
- `height`: Defines the height of the image.

### Example:
```html
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Sample Image" width="150" height="150">
```

This code displays an image with the specified source, alternative text, and dimensions.

## Anchor Tag

The `<a>` tag is used to create a hyperlink. It is commonly used with the following attributes:

- `href`: Specifies the URL of the destination for the link.
- `target`: Determines how the linked document should open. For example, `_blank` opens the link in a new tab.

### Example:
```html
<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example Website</a>
```

This code creates a link that opens the "Example Website" in a new tab.

## List Elements

Lists are used to group related items. There are different types of lists in HTML: ordered lists (`<ol>`), unordered lists (`<ul>`), and description lists (`<dl>`).

### Ordered List (OL)

The `<ol>` tag defines an ordered (numbered) list. It supports attributes such as:

- `type`: Defines the type of numbering (e.g., "1", "A", "a", "I", "i").
- `start`: Specifies the starting number for the list.

### Example:
```html
<ol type="1" start="1">
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
</ol>
```

This creates a numbered list starting from 1.

### Unordered List (UL)

The `<ul>` tag defines an unordered (bulleted) list. The items are displayed with bullet points by default. It also supports the `type` attribute to specify different types of bullet points.

### Example:
```html
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Bullet point 1</li>
    <li>Bullet point 2</li>
</ul>
```

This code creates a bulleted list with the default disc-shaped bullets.

### Description List (DL)

The `<dl>` tag defines a description list. It groups terms (`<dt>`) and their descriptions (`<dd>`). This list type does not require any specific attributes.

### Example:
```html
<dl>
    <dt>HTML</dt>
    <dd>HyperText Markup Language, used to structure web content.</dd>

    <dt>CSS</dt>
    <dd>Cascading Style Sheets, used for styling web pages.</dd>
</dl>
```

This creates a description list with terms "HTML" and "CSS" along with their respective descriptions.

## Conclusion

This document demonstrates several commonly used HTML tags with attributes, such as `<img>`, `<a>`, and list tags (`<ol>`, `<ul>`, `<dl>`). Understanding these tags and their attributes is essential for creating structured and accessible web pages.
