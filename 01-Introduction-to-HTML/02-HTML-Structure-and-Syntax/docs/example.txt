## HTML Structure Guide

 DOCTYPE Declaration:
The DOCTYPE declaration is the first line in an HTML document. It ensures the browser renders the page in standards mode.
 html
<!DOCTYPE html>
 

 Basic Structure of an HTML Document:
Every HTML document should have the following structure:
 html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <! Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
 

 Key Points:
1. The  <html>  element is the root of the HTML document.
2. The  <head>  element contains metadata, links, and scripts.
3. The  <body>  element contains the visible content.
4. Always use proper nesting and closing tags.

 Tips:
 Use semantic HTML elements for better accessibility.
 Indent code consistently for readability.
