## Understanding the Files in This Repository

This repository contains several important files that serve different purposes in your HTML learning process:

- **`index.html`:** This file contains the basic boilerplate code for an HTML document. You can use it as a foundation to start building your own HTML pages. Modify this code to experiment and see how different changes affect the display in your browser.

- **`code-explanation.txt`:** This text file provides a detailed, line-by-line explanation of the code in `index.html`. It helps you understand the purpose and functionality of each part of the code.

- **`overview.md`:** This file offers a concise introduction to HTML, explaining what HTML is, its key features, and its role in web development. It’s a great resource for understanding the foundation before diving into the code.

- **`guide.md`:** This file (the one you're currently reading) serves as the README for this repository. It includes instructions on how to save, run, and modify HTML files, along with tips to help you understand the basics of HTML.

## How to Save and Run HTML Files

### Saving the File

To create your own HTML file, follow these simple steps:

1. **Open a Text Editor:** Use any text editor of your choice (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom).

2. **Write or Paste the HTML Code:** You can write your own HTML code or paste the code from the `index.html` file into the editor.

3. **Save the File:**
    - After entering your code, save the file with a `.html` or `.htm` extension. 
    - For example, you might save your file as `my_first_page.html` or `my_first_page.htm`.
    - **Important:** The `.html` or `.htm` extension is crucial because it tells your web browser that this is an HTML file, which it can interpret and render as a webpage.

   > **Tip:** Always use `.html` for consistency, although `.htm` is also a valid extension. Some older systems use `.htm` due to filename length limitations, but `.html` is widely recognized and recommended.

### Running the File

Once you've saved your HTML file, follow these steps to see it in action:

1. **Open the File in a Browser:** Navigate to the location where you saved your HTML file, then right-click on it and select "Open with" and choose a web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge).

2. **See the Result:** The web browser will read the HTML file and render it as a webpage. You’ll be able to see the output of the HTML code in the browser window.

## Key Takeaways

- **The `.html` Extension:** The `.html` or `.htm` extension is used to identify HTML files. This extension is important because it allows your browser to recognize and display the file as a webpage. Without it, the browser may not render the file correctly.
- **Practice Regularly:** Experimenting with the code in the `index.html` file and modifying it will help reinforce your learning. The more you practice, the better you’ll understand how HTML works.
- **Explore Other Files:** Don’t forget to check out the `code-explanation.txt` and `overview.md` files. These files provide deeper insights into the HTML structure and key concepts.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a solid understanding of how to save and run HTML files, you can start experimenting with the code. Modify `index.html`, add new elements, and use the explanation in `code-explanation.txt` to guide your learning. The more you experiment, the more confident you'll become in your HTML skills.

Happy coding, and enjoy the journey to mastering HTML!
