# Text Formatting in HTML

Text formatting in HTML is the process of modifying the appearance or style of text to make it more visually appealing, readable, or meaningful. HTML provides several tags specifically designed for formatting text. These tags help in emphasizing, styling, or providing semantic meaning to the content on a webpage.

## **What is Text Formatting?**
Text formatting involves:
- Changing the text style (e.g., bold, italic, underline).
- Highlighting important parts of the text.
- Structuring text to improve readability.
- Adding semantic meaning to text elements.

HTML formatting tags not only enhance visual presentation but also improve accessibility and SEO by conveying the purpose and meaning of the content.
