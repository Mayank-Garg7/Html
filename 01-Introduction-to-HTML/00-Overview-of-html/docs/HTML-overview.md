# Overview of HTML

## What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring web pages. It provides the foundation for web development by using tags to define the content, layout, and behavior of web pages. Though not a programming language, HTML is a markup language designed to organize and present information effectively.

### Key Concepts
1. **Elements**
   - Building blocks of HTML, defined by tags like `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<img>`.
   - Each element consists of opening and closing tags, with content in between.

2. **Attributes**
   - Provide additional information about elements.
   - Examples include:
     - `src` for images: `<img src="image.jpg">`
     - `href` for links: `<a href="https://example.com">Link</a>`

3. **Tags**
   - Enclose elements and define their purpose.
   - Common tags:
     - `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Headings
     - `<p>`: Paragraphs
     - `<a>`: Hyperlinks
     - `<img>`: Images

4. **Head Section**
   - Contains meta-information about the page.
   - Includes elements like `<title>`, `<meta>`, and links to external resources (e.g., stylesheets and scripts).

5. **Body Section**
   - Contains the visible content of the page.
   - Includes text, images, tables, forms, and multimedia.
