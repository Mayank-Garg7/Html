Here is the code explanation line-by-line - 

1. <!DOCTYPE html>: This line tells the browser that the document is an HTML5 page.
2. <html> is the root element of the page, meaning everything else on the page is contained within it.
lang="en" specifies that the language of the page is English.
3. <head>: This section contains information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the page itself.
4. <meta charset="UTF-8">: This line ensures that the page can display characters from different languages correctly.
5. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This line makes the page look good on different screen sizes (like phones and tablets).
6. <title>Document</title>: This sets the title that appears in the browser tab.
7. <body>: This section contains the content that is visible on the page.
8. <h1>Welcome in HTML tutorials</h1>: This displays a large heading that says "Welcome in HTML tutorials".
9. <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>: This displays a paragraph of text.


In essence, this code creates a very basic web page with a title and some simple text content.
