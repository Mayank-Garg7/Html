Advanced Forms in HTML

This file explains key concepts covered in this topic:

1. **Fieldsets and Legends**:
   - Use `<fieldset>` to group related form elements.
   - Use `<legend>` to provide a caption for the grouped elements.

2. **Advanced Input Types**:
   - `type="date"`: Input for selecting a date.
   - `type="color"`: Input for selecting a color.
   - `type="range"`: Input for selecting a value within a range.

3. **Form Validation**:
   - Use the `required` attribute to ensure mandatory fields.
   - Use `pattern` with a regular expression for custom validation.

4. **Attributes**:
   - `autocomplete`: Suggest previous entries.
   - `novalidate`: Disable built-in form validation.

Refer to `example.html` to see these features implemented.
