# Responsive Design Guide

Responsive design ensures that your web pages look great and function properly on all devices, regardless of screen size. Below are the key aspects of responsive design:

## 1. Media Queries
Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the screen size or device type.

### Example:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for screens 768px wide or smaller */
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
```

## 2. Flexible Grids
Use relative units like percentages instead of fixed pixel values for layout widths to make your designs adaptable.

### Example:
```css
.container {
  width: 80%; /* Flexible width */
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

## 3. Responsive Images
Ensure that images scale correctly within their containers to prevent layout issues.

### Example:
```css
img {
  max-width: 100%; /* Restrict image width to its container */
  height: auto; /* Maintain aspect ratio */
}
```

## Tips for Responsive Design
- **Include a Viewport Meta Tag:** Add the following tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML to ensure proper scaling on mobile devices:
  ```html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  ```
- **Test Your Design:** Use browser developer tools or physical devices to test the responsiveness of your design across various screen sizes.
