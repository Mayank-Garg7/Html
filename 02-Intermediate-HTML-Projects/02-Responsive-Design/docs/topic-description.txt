Responsive Design:

1. Media Queries:
   - Media queries allow you to apply different styles depending on the screen size or device.
   - Example: `@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }`

2. Flexible Grids:
   - Use relative units like percentages for layout widths instead of fixed pixels.

3. Responsive Images:
   - Ensure images scale properly within their containers.
   - Use CSS properties like `max-width: 100%;` and `height: auto;`.

Tips:
- Always include a viewport meta tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML.
- Test your design on different devices or using browser developer tools.
